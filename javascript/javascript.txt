Javascript
syntax:
print statement
console.log("")--browser console
document.write("pavan kumar")--browser window
we can't writing markup language in scripting language

note:

    If a progran contains html,css and javascript then it is called
Dynamic Hypertext Markuplanguage

Javascript Engine
--Javascript engine is used to execute scriptingn code language on browser window

--It is used to convert user understandale scripting language to machine understandale
scripting language


Javascript varaibles

--A name which isk given to a memory location is called varaible
--In javascript varaibles are known as Identifiers

1.Local varaibles
    A varaible which is declare inside the function or block is called local varaible
and it will be access within the function only
2.Global varaibles
    A varaible which is declare outside the function 
and it will access inside and outside  function


Javascript Datatypes
    javascript is dynamically typed language so we dont need to define any Datatypesat the 
time of varaible declaration

Primitive Datatypes
1.number
2.boolean
3.String
4.null
5.Undefined

Non Primitive Datatypes
1.Object
2.Arrays
3.RegEx

Types of Javascripts

We have two types of Javascripts
---
1.Internal Javascript
2.External Javascript

Javascript Operators

--Operator is a symbol which is used to perform some operations on operands
1.Airthmetic Operator ---  (+,-,*,/,%,++,--)
2.Conditional Operatorn----(<,>,<=,>=,==,!=)
== vs ===
null vs Undefined
3.Bitwise Operators ----(&,|,^,!,>>,<<)
4.Logical opearators---(&&.||,!)
5.Assignment opearators---(+=,-=,/=,%=,*=)
6.Special opearatork---(?,new,typeof)

Statements
--If
--if else
--if else if

switch

loops
--while
--do while
--for loop
--for in loop

switch case we use for option Statements

functions
--Named function ----function f1(){}
--Anonymous function-- var f2=function(){}
--Arrow function --var f3==>(){}


Javascript closure
-- A closure is a combination of functions bundled together along with lexicolscope
In javascript closures are created every time when functions are created

In other words A closure gives you access to an outer functions scope from inner function


Javascript objects
--A javascript object is entity having states and behaviours
or collection of properties and functions 
javascript is a object based language because everything is present in objects

Javascriptis a template based but not class based we dont need to create a class
to get the object we can create object directly 
There are 3 ways to create objects
1.By using object literal

2.By creating instances 

3.Object Constructor

Javascript Arrays
ex: var arr=[1,2,3,4]
for(a in arr)
{
    documetn.writeIn(arr[i])
}

Javascript Strings
--Javascript string is an object which contains collection of characters
There are two ways to create string in javascript
1.By using string literal
2.By using string instance of a string
Javascript window Object

BOM(Browser object model)
--The Browser object model is used to interact with browser
The default object for a browser is window object It means we can call all the 
functions by using window or directly

ex: window.alert("welcome");
    or
    alert("Welcome to javascript")

    alert()
    confirm()
    prompt()
    innerWidth()
    innerHeight()
    open()
    close()
    moveTo()-absolute
    moveBy()-relative

setTimeout()

ex:
function f1()
{
setTimeout(function(){
    alert("Pavankumar")
},6000)
f1()

or

function f1()
{
    setTimeout(f2,4000)
}
function f2()
{
alert("Pavan kumar")
}
------------------------------------
2.Clear TIMEOUT()




setInterval()
clearInterval()

Javascript history

localstorage---doesnot expiry data will store window is close also

sessionstorage--expiry data when close window

--------------------------------------
DOM--document  object model

 functions of document

 document
     document.write()
     document.writeIn()
     document.getElementById()
     document.getElementById().innerHTML
     document.getElementsByName()
     document.getElementsByTagName()
     document.getElementByClassName()
     document.addEventListener()
        It is used to add the handler to function
     document.removeEventListener()
        It is used to remove the handler to function

javascript Date object
    Javascript Date object is used to display date and time
using javascript Date object we can display timer on the webpage

Form validation using RegEx

Javascript Regular Expression
    Regular expression are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.
In javascript, regular expressions are also objects

Javascript form validation using RegularExpression
To generate proper regular expression we can login below url


Synchronous
    step by step execution only wait for previous executing 
    As the name Synchronous means to be in a sequence i.e every  statement of the code
get executed one by one so basically a statement has to wait for the earlier statement
statement to get executed


Asynchronous
     Asynchronous code allows the program to be executed immediately where the Synchronous
code will block further execution of the remaining code until it finishes the current one. this 
may not look like a big problem byt when you see it in a bigger picture realize that it may lead
to delaying the user interface

Javascript promises
    promises are used to handle Asynchronous operations in javascript
They can handle multiple asynchronous operations easily and provide better
error handling than callbacks and events

A promise has four stages:

1)Fulfilled:Action related to the promise succeeded
2)rejected:Action related to the promise failed
3)pending:Promise is still pending i.e not fulfilled or rejected yet
4)settled:Promise has fulfilled or rejected

A Promise can be created using Promise constructor

syntax:var promise=new promise(function(resolve,reject){

        });


var vs let vs const

var
    functional scope--undefined
    we can declare witout initialization
    update values new
    It can be redeclared;
    It can be accessible without declaration and default value

let
     block scope
     we can declare witout initialization
     update values new
     It can't be redeclared;
     It can't be accessible without declaration
const 
 block scope
    we can declare with initialization
    not update values new
    It can't be redeclared;
    It can't be accessible without declaration


Hoisting
    Hoisting is the default behavior of javascript where all the variable and function declarations 
are moved on top
This means that irrespective of where the variables and functionsare declared ,they are 
move on top of the scope


Undefined vs null

==or ===



what is spread opearator in javascript ?
    The spread operator is  used to spreading an array.

ex:
var sum=0;
  function f1(num1,num2,num3)
  {
    sum=num1+num2+num3;
    document.writeIn(sum);
  }
  let arr=[10,20,30,40]
  f1(...arr);


  Recursion
    Function call itself is called Recursion
ex:
    function f1(i)
    {
        if(i<5)
        {
            document.writeIn(i);
            f1(i+1);
        }
    }
    f1(1);

what is difference between innertext and innerHTML


map() method in javascript
    it creates a new array from calling a function for every array element
    it does not execute the function for empty elements
    it doesnot change the original array

ex:
  const arr=[10,20,30];
  const newarr=arr.map(f1)

  function f1(num)
  {
    return num*10;
  }
  document.writeIn(newarr)


reduce() method
    It executes a reducer function for array element
    it returns a single value the functions accumulated result
    it doesnot execute the function for empty array elements
    it does not change the original array    

ex:
   var arr=[100,20,30];
   var res=arr.reduce(f1);
   function f1(total,ele)
   {
    return total-ele;
   }
   document.writeIn(res);

o/p: 100-20+30=50

Object oriented programming language(OOPS)
    
        A technology orlanguage is saidto be object oriented if it 
supports following features
ex: class
    object
    abstraction
    encapsulation
    inheritance
    polymorphism

Javascript is not a object oriented programming language it is a object based programming 
language because everything present in javascript is an object likes arrays strings regx Date .

1.what is class in javascript
A javascript class is not an object
It is a template for javascript objects
use the class keyword to create a class
A class keyword is used to declare a class with any particular name

According to javascript naming conventions ,the name of the class always starts 
with an uppercase letter

ex:
  <script>
    class Example
    {

    }
  </script>

2.what is constructor ?
    A javascript constructor is a special type of method which is used to initialize and
create an object

It is called when memory is allocated to object
The constructor keyword is used to declare a constructor method
The class can contain one constructor method only

Javascript allows us to use parent class constructor through super keyword
ex:
   class Example
   {
    constructor()
    {
        document.writeIn("jjl")
    }
   }

3.what is object in javascript
    A javascript object is an entity having states and behaviors(operations and methods)
syntax : var a=new object();

4.what is encapsulation in javascript

    The process of wrapping properties and functions within a single unit is known as encapsulation

To achieve an encapsulation in javascript we need to do following things
-->Use var keyword to make data members private
-->Use setter methods to set the data and getter methods to get that data

5.what is inheritance in javascript ?
 The javascript inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis
 of already existing classes
 It provides flexibility to the child class to reuse the methods and variables of a parent class
 The javascript extends keyword is used to create a child class on the basis of a parent class

 5.What is polymorphism
  The ability to represent in a different forms is called polymorphism
