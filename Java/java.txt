Escape Characters or Escape Sequences
--------------------------------------
whenever we went to display our output in neat and clean manner then we need to use 
escape Characters or escape Sequences
Every escape characters starts with blackslash(\) followed by a single characters

ex:
    \n--new line
    \t(horizontal tab)
    \b(back space)--delete back character
    \r(carriage return)--r replace backward to forward
    \f(form feeding)--
    \\(back slash)--print this get in print one \
    \"(double quote)
    \'(single quote)
System.out.println("pav\nan") -->

SDLC
-------------------------
SDLC stands for software Development Life Cycle.

It is a process adopt by IT industry to develop accurate and quality of softwares

six phasses in SDLC

1.Feability study
this pahases completely depends upon TELOS formula
ex: T-Technical feasbility
    E-Economical Feasibility
    L-legal feasbility
    O-operation feasbility
    S-Schedule Feasbility
All the above information we will write in a document 
2.Analysis
This phase system Analyst or product owner will involved
project :
    WaterFall modeel old modelnow all following agile methodolgys

They will separate System requirements and Software requirements     
They will keep above Information in  document called SRS 
srs--System requirement Specification

3.Designing
There are two types of Designing
1.High Level Designing
--------------------
        In high level Designing we will design main/major modules 
        A manager is responsible to perform high level desigining

2.Low level Designing
--------------------
        A low level desigining we will design sub module/child modules
        A team lead/project lead is responsible to perform low level desigining
 
 They will keep above Information in a document  called TDD/PDD

4.Coding
    
    In these phases developers will involved 
Developers are responsible to generating the code(build)
Once our build is ready then developers will perform white box testing

5.Test

In this phase testing team or QA team will involved
QA is responsible to perform testing on build by using a software component 
STLC(Software testing life cycle)

Once The STLC Process is done then they will perform black box testing

6.Delivery and Maintainence

Before Delivery we will perform UAT testing
UAT stands for User Acceptance testing

it is divided into two types
1)Alpha testing
---------------
    Testing which is done at company location is called alpha testing

2)Beta Testing
--------------
    Testing which is done at Client location is called beta testing

Once UAT testing is done successfully then project is ready for Delivery

What is Java ?
    Java is a object oriented platform independent , case Sensitive , Strongly typed checking,
high level,open source programming language developed by James Gosling in the year of 1995

Features of Java?
We have following important features in java

1.Simple
2.Object oriented
3.High level
4.platform independent
5.Architecture Neutral
6.Portable
7.Highly secured
8.Robust
9.Dynamic

Q)Which package is a default package in java?
java.lang package

Q)How many classes are there in java ?
java 7 - 4024 classes
java 8 - 4240 classes
java 9 - 6005 classes
java 10 - 6002 classes

Q)Who is the responsible to destroy the objects in java?

Garbage collector

Q)In how many ways we can call garbage collector in java ?

There are two ways to call garbage collector in java
1.System.gc(); or System.close();
2.Runtime.getRuntime().gc();



History of java
-------------------
1990--->sun micro system --->took on project--->software
        consumer electronic device (stealth project -->green project)
James Gosling,Mike Sherdin and patrick naughton
        place---.Aspan/colardo(Graphic system)
but problem found said by James Gosling --->c and c++ languages (System dependent)
so why not we create programming language System independent
System independent-->1991-->OAK-->sILK-->1995 OAK -->JAVA


Identifiers
------------
Name in java is called Identifier

It can be class name,variable name,method name or label name

Every identifier is case Sensitive

Reserved words(53)--->keywords(50)  and Reserved literals(3)

Q)what is the Difference between JDK ,JRE AND JVM
Java software-->JDK
jdk stands for java development kit
It is a installable software which consists java runtime environment(JRE),Java virtual maachine(JVM),
Compiler (javac) ,interpreter(java),Archiever(.jar),document generator (javadoc) and other tools needed
for java application development

JRE
----
JRE stands for java runtime environment
it provides very good environment to run java application only

JVM
---
JVM stands for java virtual machine
jvm is an interpreter which is used to execute our program line by line procedure

DIAGRAM check in screenchots


Java 
------
version   : java8
jdk       : 1.8v
creator   : james gosling
vendor    :oracle
opensource:yes

Softwares----->Express edition(classes,Institute,internet,academics etc.. for free)
        
        ----->Enterprise Edition(IT Company ,but not free(commercial))


        javac
javaApp------->.class file(byte code)---->clasfolder/sub system

if byte instruction is ok then load to classloader it allocate memory otherwise refused
How many Memorys in java
Method Area     HEAP(objects)    JAVA stack(variables)      pc Register     Native methodstack(native method interfce)



IN Execution engine contains interpreter and just in time Compiler
whenever jvm is loading to byte code interpreter and jit compiler using so that it can generate byte code

then it load to operating system


Internal Architecture of JVM
----------------------------------
    Java application contains java code instruction once if we compiler java code instructions convert to byte code
    instruction in (.classfile)

    Jvm will invoke one module called classloader/sub system to load all the byte code instruction form
    .class file and the classloader is to check these byte code instructions are proper or not if they are not proper
    it will refuse the Execution if they are proper it will allocate memory

Java contains five types of memory
1)Method Area
It contains code of a class ,code of a method and code of a variable
2)HEAP
our object creation will stor in heap Area
3)stack
java methods execute in method area but to execute those methods it requires save
memory that memory will be allocated in java stack
4)PC Register
it is a program counter Register which is used to track the address of an instruction
5)Native methods stack
Java methods will execute in method area
similarly native methods will execute in native method stack
but to execute native methods required a program called Native method interface


Execution engine
-----------------
whenever JVM loads byte code instructions from .class file ,it simultaneously uses interpreter and JIT compiler
interpreter is used to execute our program line by line procedure
JIT compiler is increased speed of Execution program

Q)what is packages
collection of classes and interfaces

Q)How many classloaders are there in java?
1)Bootstrap classloader(it loads rt.jar file)
2)Extension classloader(it loads all jar folders from ext folder )
3)Application/system classloader(it loads .class file from classpath)

video--8
----------------
Datatypes
two types 
1)Primitive datatype
Numeric datatype---byte,short,int,long,float,double
Boolean datatype----Boolean
character datatype----char

2)Non-Primitive datatype
String
Arrays
class
Interface
and etc

ex:write a program to find  min and max value of byte ?
class Test{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        System.out.println(Byte.MIN_VALUE);
        System.out.println(Byte.MAX_VALUE);
    }
}

q)Is java purely object oriented or not?

No Java will not consider as purely object oriented programming language
because it does not support many OOPS Concepts like multiple inheritance,
operator overloading and moreover we depends upon primitive datatypes which are non-objects


video-9
--------------------------
A name which is given to a memory location is called variable
purpose of variable is used to store data
In java variables are divided into two types
1)Primitive variable
    It is used to represent primitive values
2)Reference variables
    It is used to represent object Reference
    ex:
      student s=new student();
      here s is Reference variable
Based on the position and execution above variables are divide in to three types
1)Instance variables/non-static variable

A value of variable which is change from object to object is called Instance varaiable
Instance varaiable will be created at the time of object creation AND it will destroy at the time of object
destruction hence  scope of an instance varaiable is same as  scope of an object

Instance varaiables will store in Heap area as a part of an object
Instance varaiables must and should declare immediately after the class
but not inside methods,blocks and constructors

Instance varaible we can access from instance area but we cannot access directly from
static area

To access instance varaiable from static area we need to create object Reference
ex:
 int i=10;
 Test t1=new Test();

ex:
class Test
{
    int i=10;
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        Test t=new Test();
        System.out.println(t.i);//10
    }
}

ex:
class Test{
    public static void main(String []arsg)
    {
        Test t1=new Test();
        t1.m1();
    }
    //non static method
    public void m1(){
        System.out.println("Instance method");
    }
}
  
note: if we won't intialise instance varaiable then jvm  it will create default value;

2)static variables/global variables
A value of a varaiable which is not varaied from object t object is called static variable

A static varaiable will be created at the time of classloading and it will destroy at the 
time of class unloading hence scope of static varaiables as same as scope of a .class file

static variable will store in method area 
static varaiable we can access directly from instance area as well as static area
static varaiable we can access by using object Reference and by classname
ex:
class Test{
    static int i=1;
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        System.out.println(i);
        System.out.println(Test.i);
        Test t1=new Test();
        System.out.println(t1.i);
    }
}

note: If we won't intialise any value to static variable then JVM will intialised default value

3)local variables/Temperory variables/Automatic variables

we will declare varaiables inside methods ,blocks and constructors such type of varaiables are
called local varaiables

A local varaiable will be created at the time of execution block and it will destroy when 
execution block is executed hence scope of local varaiable is same as scope of a executionblock
where it is declared

local varaiables will store java stack memory
ex:
class Test{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        int i=10;
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}

note:If we won't initialize any value to local varaiable then JVM will not initialized
default values

video-10
---------------------------------
whenever we used import statements we should not use fully qualified name
using shortname also we can Achieve (classes and interface)
in java we have three import statements
1)Expilict class import 
This is type of import statement is highly recommanded to use because it is used to improve
readability of our code
ex:
import java.util.Date;
import java.time.LocalDate;
class Test{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        Date d=new Date();
        System.out.println(D);
        LocalDate date=new LocalDate.now();
        System.out.println(date);
    }
}

2)Implicit class import
This type of import statement is not recommanded to use because it will reduce the readability 
of our code
ex:
import java.util.*;

3)Static import
Using static import we can call static members directly
often use of static import makes our program complex and unredable 

ex:
import static java.lang.System.*;
public Test{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        out.println("pavan");
    }
}
ex: Api

Main Method
--------------
java program contains main method or not
Either it is properly declared or not .It is not a responsibility of a compiler to check.
it is a liability of a JVM to check main method always at runtime
if jvm won't find main method thenit will throw one runtime error called main method not found

Jvm looks for main method with following signature

1)orde of modifiers is not important incase of public static we can declare static 
public also
ex:static public void main(String []args)
we can change String[] array with var-arg parameter
ex:
public static void main(String... args)
we can replace args with any java identifier(String []pav)


Q)what is Literal ?
 A value is assign to a variable is called literals
 A value which is not change during the program execution is called literal
 ex: int i=10;
 10 -->value of variable/literal
 i -->varaiable Name/Identifier
 int -->Datatype/Keyword

 Q)Explain main method in java?
 public:jvm wants to call main method from anywhere
static :jvm wants to call this method without using object Reference
void : main method does not return anything to jvm
main : it is an identifier given to main method
String[] args:It is a command line argument

command line arguments
-------------------------
Arguments which are passing through command prompt such type of arguments are called
command line arguments
In command line arguments we need to pass our inputs at runtime command

ex:
class Test{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        Sop(args[0])
    }
}
javac test.java
java test 101
//101


video--11
--------------------------------------------------
System.out.println()
It is output statement in javaI
It means whenever we want to display any data or userdefined statements then we need to use
System.out.println();

syntax:

System.out.println("hoho");--->here System-->predefined final class
                                    out--->Static variable
                                    println-->predefined method

Java Basic Programs
--------------------------------------
Q)write programme to add two numbers
Q)cube ,square
Q)area of circle
Q)perimeter of circle
Q)Swapping of two numbers
Q)Swapping without third variable using
a=a+b;
b=a-b;
a=a-b;
Q)10% of salary tds (sal*10/100)
Q)find CGPA to percentage
float percentage=cgpa*9.5f;


video-11
-------------------------------------------
1)Implicit typecasting
    If we want to store smaller value into a bigger varaiable then we need to use Implicit
    typecasting
A compiler is responsible to perform Implicit typecasting
There is no possibility to loss the information
this is also known as widening or upcasting
syntax:
byte--->short-->char-->int-->long-->float-->double

ex:
class Test{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        int i=5;
        float f=i;
        System.out.print(f)//5.0
    }
}

2)Explicit typecasting
    If we want to store bigger value into smaller varaiable then we need to use explicit typecasting

    A programmer is responsible to perform explicit typecasting
There is a possibility to loss the information
it is also known as narrowing downcasting
ex:
byte<--short<---char<--int<--long<--float<--double

ex1:
clas Test{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        float f=10.5f;
        int i=(int)f;
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}

Operators
------------------
operator is a symbol,which is used to perform some operations on operands 
1)Assignment Operators
2)Conditional/Ternary Operators
3)Logical Operators
4)Bitwise Operators
5)Airthmetic Operators
6)Relational Operators
7)Unary operators

Q)greatest of three numbers
int max=(a>b)?((a>c)?a:c):((b>c)?b:C)

-->How to convert decimal to binary
20-decimal number
2|_20_ -->0 reminder for 2*10=0
2|_10_ -->0 reminder  for 2*5=0
2|_5_  -->1 reminder for 2*2=1
2|_2_  -->0 reminder for 2*1=0
   1
-->How to covert binary to decimal

1010--binary number
10-- decimal

1010---0*1 + 1*2 + 0*4 + 1*8 =10;

Right shift operator
--------------------
it will double form 1 digit like 
1=2
2=4,8,16,32,64,128 etc....
10>>1 = 10/2 =5
10>>2 =10/4 =2
100 >> 5 =100/32 = 3

left shift operator
-------------------
it will multiply with double numbers
2,4,8,16,32,64
10 << 3 =10*8 =80
10 << 2 =10*4 =40

post increment
----------------
int i=10;
j=i++
o/p- j=10,i=11

pre increment
---------------
int i=10;
j=++i
o/p- j=10,i=10

Types of blocks in java
---------------------------------
A block is a set of statements which is enclosed in a curly braces {}
ex: {
        //set of statements
    }
In java we have three types of blocks
1)Instance block
Instance block is used to initialize the instance variables
Instance block will execute at the time object creation   
we can declare instance block as follow
syntax:
        //instance block
        {
            --
            --//set of statements
        }

ex:1
    class Test{
        //instance block
        {
            System.out.println("instance block");
        }
        public static void main(String []args)
        {
            System.out.println("Main method")
            Test t=new Test();
        }
    }

o/p: main method
    instance block

2)Static block

A static block is used to initialize the static and always execute first than main method

ex:
class Test{
    static
    {
        System.out.println("static block");
    }
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        System.out.println("main method");
    }
}

o/p:static block
    main method


3)Local block

A loacl block is used to initialize the local varaiable
A local block will execute just like a normal statement
A local block must and should declare inside methods and constructors

syntax:{
            //local block
        }

        num(1)
    }
    public static void num(int i)
     {
        if(i<=10)
        {
            System.out.print(i+" ");
            display(i+1);
        }
     }
}

Q)print sum of two numbers without using Airthmetic operator?

    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.print(sum(5,11));
    }
    public static int sum(int a,int b)
    {
        if(a==0)
          returnb;
        return sum(--a,++b);
    }
}
